# cache-simulator
For this project I worked on understanding the impact of cache
memories on program performance. There were two parts to this 
project. Csim.c is a program that simulates the behavior of a 
cache memory. Trans.c is a program that optimizes the transformation
functions of specific sized matrices.

This project does not study a real cache, but a small made-up cache
that is assessed according to a sequence of memory references from
real programs, which are replayed against the cache simulator.
